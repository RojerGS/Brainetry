Lo and
behold: this program has
a self referential property! This code prints its
first, middle and last
chars! How nice!
Of course I cheated a little and made
this program in such a
way that alL
3 of those chars are the upper case L,
which I
also had
to properly place in
the middle of this
text to make sure they appeared in those positions.
A bit of
luck and a bit of mathematics allowed
me to accomplish this feat. Let me
check it... Woops, missed by one... LOL
