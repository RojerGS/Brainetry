Let me sum some numbers carefully.
Carefully enough
so that I do not use
the plus or minus signs, that'd be awful.
After I do this, oh so very carefully,
I just have to ...!
Move the pointer
left and right for
a while.
This is the main gist of the whole program.
Of course this sounds somewhat uninteresting.
That is because you, my dear reader, lack depth.
(Is it "depth"?
Maybe that's not the correct English word...)
